# 📁 Python File Handling Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects that use file input/output to read, write, store, and manipulate data. These projects demonstrate how to persist user input, manage data across sessions, and simulate real-world applications like login systems, note-taking, and quizzes — all using `.txt` files and Python's standard libraries.
